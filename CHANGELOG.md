# Changelog

Notable changes to `@leemour/cli-messaging`, one section per version, newest first. Versions follow
[semver](https://semver.org/); before `1.0.0` a minor version may break callers, and says how under
"Changed — may break callers". `pnpm docs:check` checks the shape of this file.

## Unreleased

## 0.29.1 — 29.09.2026

### Fixed

- **`messages list --jsonl` and `messages search --jsonl` print one message per line**, as `inbox`,
  `watch` and their own `--help` promise. They printed the whole page as one JSON line. A script that
  worked around it by reading `.items` from that line must now read each line as a message; the hint
  about older messages goes to stderr.

## 0.29.0 — 29.09.2026

### Fixed

- **Depends on `@leemour/cli-core` 0.8.0** (was 0.7.0), the version max-cli uses. With two versions a CLI
  installed two copies, and `isCliError()` — an `instanceof` check — did not recognise an error made by
  the other copy.

Nothing in the package yet. The repository gained a coverage floor, `pnpm test:slow`,
`pnpm docs:check` and developer docs, and `bin/release` takes the next free version itself.

## 0.28.0 — 29.09.2026

### Added

- **A read across a chosen list of accounts.** `accounts` in a message filter and in `people()`
  names several accounts of one provider by native id — max-cli's `--bots a,b`. A list without its
  provider is refused, so a read is never across every account by accident.

### Changed — may break callers

- **Message search finds any three letters inside a word** (store migration 5 rebuilds the index
  with the trigram tokenizer). Every word of three characters or more must appear; shorter ones are
  ignored, and a query of only short words is refused.

## 0.27.0 — 29.09.2026

### Added

- **A new `MessengerAdapter` method is optional** and reached with `capability()`, which refuses
  with `validation_error` rather than crashing when the adapter lacks it. `observed` and `stored`
  pass through any method they do not list, so an adapter's new method needs no wrapper edit.
  Inside, the shared commands and the MCP tools are one file per resource; the exports and the
  behaviour are unchanged.

## 0.26.0 — 29.09.2026

### Changed — may break callers

- **People are kept per account** (store migration 4, `account_identities`). An identity stays one
  per provider, and which account has seen it is a row of its own, so one bot's people are not
  another's. `savePeople` takes an `AccountKey` instead of a `Provider`, and `people()` reads through
  the account.

## 0.25.0 — 29.09.2026

### Added

- **`inboxCommand`**: other people's unread messages in every chat, or with `--new` what arrived
  since the last check — each message once, the saved point moved only by a run that printed.
  `--since` takes an ISO time or `30m`/`2h`/`1d`. With the MCP tool `<cli>_inbox` and the
  `catch-up` prompt.

## 0.24.0 — 28.09.2026

### Added

- **`skillCommand(app, url)`**: `skill show` prints the CLI's own SKILL.md for an agent.
- **MCP prompts** `reply` and `find`, and the resource `<cli>://chat/{id}` — a chat and its recent
  messages, listed from the store without connecting.

Older versions: `git log --oneline v0.23.0` and the release commits (`chore: release X`).
