# Ranking stored messages and authors

Statistics use `stats → resource → view`. Replace `app` below with `max` or `tg`.
The commands read the local store and do not connect by default. Fetch the relevant history
first; a ranking describes held data, not all activity in the messenger.

```sh
app stats messages top 'chat:room date:[2026-10-01 TO 2026-10-08}' --measure reactions --limit 10 --json
app stats contacts top 'chat:room date:[2026-10-01 TO 2026-10-08}' --score helpful --min-messages 3 --json
app stats contacts top --weights '{"messages":0.4,"active-days":0.6}' --timezone Europe/Madrid --json
```

## Measures and scores

| Target | Measures | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Messages | views, reactions, forwards, comments, replies, thread-size | reactions |
| Human authors | messages, words, reactions, replies, answers, answer-time, threads, active-days | messages |

`answer-time` sorts ascending by median milliseconds; the other measures sort descending.
`--message-kind posts` or `comments` selects proven kinds before aggregation.
Unknown old linkage is reported rather than guessed. Linked channel comments may live in a
stored discussion group; the answer lists expanded discussion chats and their coverage.

`--score helpful` weights answers 0.5, replies from others 0.25 and reactions 0.25.
`--score active` weights active days 0.6 and messages 0.4. Both apply to authors.
`--score engaging` weights reactions and nonself replies equally; author scores use per-message
rates and require five selected messages unless `--min-messages` overrides that threshold.
`--weights` replaces every preset weight. Names must be supported components for the target,
weights finite and nonnegative, and at least one positive. `--measure` conflicts with scores.

Score version 1 normalizes each component against the maximum among all eligible rows before
`--limit`: `100 × sum(weight × value / maximum) / sum(weight)`. A zero maximum contributes zero.
Missing positive components exclude a row from scoring. A zero weight ignores that component.
The response includes maxima, component values, contributions and exclusion counts.

## Scope and quality

Queries use strict Lucene with `--chat`, `--source`, `--exact` and `--timezone` as in message search.
A top page contains 1–100 rows. Text and author predicates select ranked messages; reply context
uses authorized stored messages in the same query period without those text or author filters.
Graph metrics reject ambiguous date branches: use a common positive date range.

Views, reactions, forwards and comment counters are cumulative stored snapshots. Their
per-field observation times and freshness are disclosed when an authoritative read supplied them; a date filter selects messages, not reactions
received within that period. Unknown counters are distinct from zero. Author reaction totals
can be partial, with known and unknown message counts. `--sync-first` is guarded and bounded;
it fetches newer messages and does not refresh old counters.

Answers are a heuristic: a question contains `?` after URL removal, and its first direct reply
by another known human author is credited. Self replies and channel identities do not qualify.
Words use version 1 letter/digit runs with URLs removed. Active days use the selected timezone.
Coverage and graph quality tell you when held history is incomplete. No metric proves helpfulness.

## Follow the evidence

Each row returns `drilldown.selection` and exact `drilldown.evidence.arguments` for its evidence
command. Pass that selection as JSON, with the emitted message locator or native person id:

```sh
app stats messages evidence msg:tg/fixture/room/101 --selection "$selection" --component replies --limit 20 --json
app stats contacts evidence 42 --selection "$selection" --component answers --limit 20 --json
```

Replies include their parent; answers include the question and credited answer. Snapshot metrics
show measured messages, not lists of viewers or reactors. Author `messages` evidence exposes
all selected messages even when ranking by a score. Active-day evidence lists underlying
messages; its one-per-message contributions are not summed into distinct days.

Evidence includes `total`, `included`, `hasMore` and `nextCursor`. Continue with the same
arguments and `--cursor`. A changed contributing row rejects the cursor; restart without it.
Each page retains complete rows within a 64 KiB items budget. An oversized single row directs
you to `messages show`. Fingerprinting is bounded to 50,000 rows and 8 MiB of stored inputs;
narrow chat/date scope when the query exceeds a budget. Selection JSON is capped at 64 KiB.

## Find questions and posts that need attention

After loading the relevant history, you can ask your agent: “Show questions in the club that have
waited more than a day, and open the original messages.” These reports read the stored archive;
an empty report cannot prove that nobody asked a question when history is missing.

```sh
app stats messages unanswered --chat Club --older-than 24h --json
app stats contacts responses --chat Club --answerer 42 --answerer 73 --json
app stats chats newcomers Club --since-time 2026-10-01T00:00:00Z --within 7d --json
app stats messages discussion --chat News --min-views 100 --max-replies 0 --json
```

`unanswered` orders detected questions by age. A question contains `?` outside URLs; this is a
heuristic. Only a direct explicit reply from another identifiable human qualifies. A later reply
can answer a question even when its date/text does not match the question query. Replies to oneself
and the next speaker without a reply link do not qualify. `no-observed-answer` describes saved
history, rather than proof that no answer exists in the messenger.

`responses` requires the identities to measure with repeated `--answerer`. They are user-selected
people, not verified past administrator roles. It shows response count, median and p90 latency in
milliseconds; no response gives null timings. P90 uses the nearest rank, rounded up. Without
`--answerer`, unanswered and newcomer reports accept any other identifiable human. Names, aliases and @usernames resolve only from the selected accounts’ stored identities; ambiguity returns scoped candidates and missing names return a recovery error. Bare numeric IDs need
one scoped account; use `person:<provider>/<account>/<id>` for multiple accounts.

`newcomers` defaults to joins in the last 30 days and questions within seven days after a known
join. `--until-time` ends the join cohort. First-seen-only identities are counted separately in
`summary.unknownJoin`, not assigned a joining date. A rejoin is a separate stay. Pending help windows
and incomplete member history are reported; no saved question does not mean no help was needed.

`discussion` examines stored channel posts. It compares known cumulative views with observed direct discussion replies. Provider
comment snapshots remain separate; their per-field observation freshness is disclosed; old records remain unknown. Linked discussion needs stored
link metadata and its group's history. Missing counters or graph links are not zero.

Each row provides `drilldown.command` and exact arguments. Run its existing messages/contacts
`evidence` command with `--component report` and the returned selection. Follow `nextCursor` with
the same arguments. The captured cutoff remains fixed; changed evidence requires a fresh report.
Evidence items fit within 64 KiB. Narrow the chat/date scope if the 50,000-node or 8 MiB budget is
exceeded. Look at `quality.archives` and `quality.graph` before drawing conclusions, then open the
returned message locator with `messages show` to check the original context.

You can save a report's returned selection with `searches create waiting --selection "$selection"`
and rerun the matching view with `--saved waiting`. Resolved accounts, chat, root dates and answerers
remain pinned; typed report options replace inherited values. Each new run captures a fresh observation
cutoff for replies. A saved report cannot run as a different report kind or an ordinary ranking.
Report history stores parameters and resolved selections, never result messages. Evidence is not recorded.

## Save a resolved ranking

```sh
app searches create weekly --selection "$selection"
app stats contacts top --saved weekly --limit 20 --json
```

Use the matching message/contacts target. Resolved ids and date boundaries stay pinned;
additional query words narrow the saved scope. Typed ranking options replace stored ones.
Pinned selections read held data and refuse `--sync-first`; run an ordinary query to refresh.
History records parameters, not result bodies. Evidence is never recorded as search history.

MCP discovers and invokes these same paths through the existing three-tool frontend. Selection
is a structured object there. See the [command contract](plans/2026-10-07-rankings-contract.md)
and [CLI standard](dev/STANDARD.md) for the public interface and standards references.

## Retention from roster observations

Ask your agent: “For the group called Club, show how many newcomers were still observed after one,
seven and thirty days. Show unknown observations and members who wrote within their first week.”
The answer needs known joining dates and saved member-list observations. A first sighting is not a joining date.

```sh
tg stats chats retention Club --checkpoints 1d,7d,30d --within 7d --timezone Europe/Madrid --json
```

The default joining period is the last 90 days, grouped by Monday week. `--by day`, `--since-time`
and `--until-time` change the cohorts. Checkpoints accept up to ten increasing positive durations.
Each checkpoint uses the first saved roster observation at or after its target, within 24 hours.
Evidence includes its actual time and lag. Presence is observable even in a partial list;
absence needs a complete list. No qualifying observation means unknown; a future checkpoint is pending.
The reported rate is present / observable. Eligible, unknown and pending counts stay visible.
This is observed membership at checkpoints; it does not prove uninterrupted membership.

Departures have an interval after the last positive sighting and at or before the first complete absence.
An interval crossing the first-week boundary cannot prove an early departure. Rejoining starts a separate stay.
A saved message proves observed activity. No message means no observed message; `archiveCovered` shows
whether the archive covers the full window. The report does not infer a silent-member rate for the whole group.
Copy a cohort's drilldown arguments into `stats messages evidence --component report` to page through members.
Selections pin the cutoff; changed observations invalidate the cursor. Evidence pages are bounded to 64 KiB.

## Check and refresh counters

Ask your agent: “Check how old the view and reaction counts are for the selected Club messages.
Preview a refresh of at most twenty messages, then refresh those exact targets.”
A message's sending date and the time it was saved do not establish when its counters were observed.

```sh
tg stats messages counters show --chat Club --counters views,reactions --max-age 24h --limit 20 --json
tg stats messages counters refresh --chat Club --counters views,reactions --max-messages 20 --sync-time 30s --dry-run --json
```

`show` reads locally and returns each field's value, `observedAt`, source, age and `freshness`:
`fresh`, `stale` or `unknown`. The default threshold is 24 hours. Missing or invalid fields are unknown,
not zero. Views, reactions and comments are independent; refreshing one does not freshen the others.
The returned `selection` pins exact locators and can be passed as JSON with `--selection`.
It conflicts with extra query and scope options.

`refresh` reads the messenger and writes local observations. It requires an explicit chat or pinned selection,
uses the active account, defaults to twenty messages and 30 seconds, and caps messages at 100 and time at five minutes.
`--dry-run` resolves exact targets and supported counters without connecting. The real refresh uses
`stats.messages.counters.refresh` write permission and message read permission. It sends no messages,
marks nothing read and requests no view increment. Unsupported, missing, failed and interrupted work
remain explicit in the result. Counter-only writes preserve message bodies, replies, attachments and tombstones.
Old/imported messages acquire no guessed timestamps; a legacy writer changing a value makes its freshness unknown.

After refresh, run `show` again for the returned selection and inspect each field's observation date.
A refreshed cumulative count still does not tell you how many views or reactions happened during a date-filtered period.

## Find the person before interpreting zero replies

Use a stored name, local alias or @username for `--answerer`, or choose an explicit ID from
`contacts show/list` or `stats contacts top`. Names resolve locally without connecting or fetching.
When several identities match, choose from the returned account/provider/ID candidates; do not guess.
An unknown name is an error, rather than an invented identity with zero replies. Known opaque IDs
are accepted; to explicitly select an unseen opaque ID, use `person:provider/account/id`.

Response rows expose `identityKnown`. An explicitly selected ID without stored identity observations
has `identityKnown: false` and `status: unknown`; a zero count is not evidence that this person never
answered. A known identity can have zero **observed** qualifying replies, with the usual archive gaps.
Saved reports and drilldowns pin the resolved identity, so a later rename does not retarget them.
