/**
 * Stops the whole command at `ms`, and **closes what it was holding on the way out**.
 *
 * ⚠ The closing is the part that matters, and it is what a plain `Promise.race` does not do.
 * Racing only decides which answer is printed; the losing work carries on, and an open WebSocket
 * keeps Node alive — so a command that reported a timeout would then sit there, which is worse
 * than the wait it was cutting short. A test covers exactly that, by
 * taking the closing away and watching what is left behind.
 *
 * A connection closed with a request still in flight must reject that request, not strand it —
 * that is what lets the body unwind through its own `finally` rather than hanging underneath this.
 *
 * ⚠ **It bounds everything, not only what talks to the network.** A local search never opens a
 * socket at all and still has to fit the budget: an agent handing out thirty seconds does not
 * know which commands are the networked ones, and a bound that quietly did not apply to some of
 * them would be worse than no bound.
 *
 * Without a bound there is no timer and no race: the ordinary path is exactly what it was.
